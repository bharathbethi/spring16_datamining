Resource Management for mass transportation
The title of my project is called Resource Management for mass transportation. The purpose of my experiment was to find out intelligent planning of mass transit infrastructure.
Motivation:
Mass transit is more efficient, cheaper and sometimes faster than personal vehicles, but Americans are accustomed to driving. How should Americans be encouraged to use mass transit? What would make mass transit more appealing than driving a car?
High gas prices, congestion, and limited numbers of parking spots are all factors that tend to contribute to people choosing mass transit over driving. To encourage use of mass transit, fares need to be affordable, and the quality of the service must be high – frequent service with high coverage and good communication to customers are all important factors.
Basic problem that is being solved:
Balancing modern transportation needs with Global Warming Mitigation
Pre-Requisite Knowledge:
Team should be aware of the current technologies available in today’s vehicles and transportation network.
Learning Objectives:
•	Understand how ITS maximizes the efficiency of an existing transportation system
•	Identify the various components of a Smart Mass Transit System
•	Explain how a smart transportation system contributes to the operation of a smart city.
Investigating Questions:
1.	What are the benefits and drawbacks of mass transit? How could mass transit be improved?
2.	What new systems of public transportation do you think will exist in the future?
